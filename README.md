# kisuke.vim

Another AI plugin for Vim.

- Work in progess, to be updated...

## My Motivation

Most of my colleagues and developer friends switched to cursor, I was feeling like staying behind because of not doing the thing everyone does. Even though I use AI a lot I felt like not using a IDE like Cursor makes me a slower developer. Making a vim plugin with Cursor like features seemed like a cool side project when I first thought about it. Then little bit googling I found out there are similliar projects but most of them and the most advanced ones are for NeoVim. I wanted to build a plugin with VimScript and learn the language. I'll add as many features as I can to this plugin, I'm developing this for my satisfaction and needs.
